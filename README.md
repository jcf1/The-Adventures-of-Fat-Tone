# The Adventures of Fat Tone
The story begins with Anthoney, a lonely Williams College student, who after hours of coding decides to go out into the world and explore. However, as he makes it to town, his friend, Evan Williams, sends him a frantic text asking for help. Panicking, Tony sets out to find his friend, but there is one big problem: He doesn't know where Evan is! He now must make a choice: 1) Go to the forrest, and hope Evan went out looking for the Magical Herb; or 2) Go to the Dungeon, the mysterious place called Sawyer, and hope that Evan is there, lost among its many corridors and rooms. Which will he go to first? It's up to you to decide...

This game was inspired by a dear friend of the same name. Currently that dear friend is abroad, but we hope this game will show him how much we have missed him over the last semester. May he have fun wherever he is now!

Special thanks to Nola, Alexis, Harold and our CS Professor, Brent Heeringa, all of whom appear in our game in one form or another. Thank you for playing along, even if we did not ask you to be in our game. None of this was made with the intention of mocking anyone.

ENJOY!
